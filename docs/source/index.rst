Welcome to GeanyPy's documentation!
===================================

GeanyPy allows people to write their Geany plugins in Python making
authoring a plugin much more accessible to non C programmers.  What follows
is a description of installing and using the GeanyPy plugin, paving the way
for the rest of the documentation to covert the details of programming with
the GeanyPy bindings of the Geany  API.
